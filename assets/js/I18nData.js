Whether it is classical music, pop, rock, pop, jazz, folk or anything in between we can cover it in our lessons. You know what you want to play, but there's no sheet music available? No problem!

You can do it solo or with collaboration with other instrumentalists. But no pressure! For those who don't want to do it publicly, we will make a video of your piano performance without any audience. This way you can still perform and express yourself but with no stress.",
